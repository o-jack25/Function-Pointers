# Project1

This lab I completed is to show how function pointers work and how it can greatly simplify code.

In main1.cpp, I was tasked with completing main() by creating and calling 2 function pointers and using them to add and multiply two numbers.

In main2.cpp, I was tasked to support 4 operations which each take 2 parameters. I was to complete the code by using an array of function pointers to create a working calculator. 

In main3.cpp, I was tasked with running the debugger on the program and explain what happens when the input is 0,1,2, and 3. Next, I was to run the debugger on the program with an input of 4. In short, it was to show "Access violation executing location error" when the program is run with the first set of inputs. For the last input, 4, it was to show how instead of "Access violation executing location error" you get an error that says "Access violation reading location". Technically saying that the program is trying to access a memory location where it doesn't have access to. You cannot dereference a pointer that has already been deallocated from memory.
